# DSA_EXPERIMENTS

This repository contains C implementations of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) experiments for academic purposes. Each experiment covers fundamental data structures or algorithms. **Experiment 10** is excluded as it is out of the syllabus.

## Experiments:

1. **Stack using Array**  
   - Implementation of stack operations using an array (push, pop, display).

2. **Infix to Postfix using Stack**  
   - Conversion of infix expression to postfix using stack data structure.

3. **Linear Queue using Array**  
   - Implementation of a linear queue using an array (enqueue, dequeue, display).

4. **Circular Queue using Array**  
   - Implementation of a circular queue (enqueue, dequeue, display).

5. **Singly Linked List**  
   - Implementation of a singly linked list with insertion and deletion operations.

6. **Stack/Queue using Linked List**  
   - Implementation of stack and queue using linked lists.

7. **Circular Singly Linked List**  
   - Circular singly linked list operations (insert at beginning/end, delete from beginning/end).

8. **Circular Doubly Linked List**  
   - Circular doubly linked list operations (insert at beginning/end, delete from beginning/end).

9. **Binary Search Tree (BST)**  
   - Implementation of BST with insertion, deletion, and traversals (inorder, preorder, postorder).

10. **N/A (Out of syllabus)**

11. **BFS and DFS on Graph using Adjacency Matrix**  
   - Implementation of Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS) using an adjacency matrix.

12. **Binary Search**  
   - Implementation of binary search on a sorted array.

13. **Sorting Algorithms (Selection, Bubble, Insertion)**  
   - Implementation of selection sort, bubble sort, and insertion sort algorithms.

14. **Merge Sort and Quick Sort**  
   - Implementation of merge sort and quick sort algorithms.

## How to Run:

Each experiment folder contains:
- C source code (.c file).
- Compile using any C compiler (e.g., GCC).
- Run and test using input as per instructions in the code.
